    <p>The active voice verb expansion rule is</p>

    <p>T (M) (have + -en) (be + -ing) MV</p>

    <h3>T = tense</h3>
    	<p>Tense is a grammatical concept; it may not be the same as
    "time." English has two tenses: present and past. The tense affects the
    first item in the verb phrase.  If the tense is present, the first item
    in the verb phrase will be present tense. If the tense is past, the first
    item in the verb phrase will be past.  Tense is always a part of every
    active voice verb phrase.</p>

    <h3>(M) = modal auxiliary verb</h3>
    	<p>The M is in parentheses because it isn¹t
    always present. A modal verb indicates probability, possibility,
    obligation, and the like. English has six major modal verbs. Four of them
    have present and past tense forms:</p>

      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Present</th><th>Past</th>
        </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Will</td><td>Would</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Shall</td><td>Should</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Can</td><td>Could</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>May</td><td>Might</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>"Tense" refers to the grammatical form of the verbs, not to "time."  If
    you "may eat," that doesn¹t mean you are eating now, in the present. And
    if you "might eat," that doesn¹t mean you were eating in the past. In
    fact, we often use modal verbs to convey information about the future, as
    in "You will eat."</p>

    <p>Two more modals have no past tense form:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>Must</li>
      <li>Ought to</li>
  </ul>
  
    <p>(Other groups of words, called "quasi-modals", also sometimes fill this
    slot, e.g., "have to.")</p>

    <h3>(have + -en) = A form of the verb "have" followed by the ­en form of
    whatever verb comes next</h3>
     <p> These items are in parentheses because they
    aren¹t always present. When a "have" is present, the verb that
    immediately follows it MUST take the ­en form. The (have + -en) conveys
    the perfect aspect, which includes information such as verb completion,
    duration, and repetition‹time-related elements that are not related to
    past, present, or future. The ­en form of the verb will only end in the
    letters ­en some of the time; with regular verbs, the ­en form looks the
    same as the ­ed form. To figure out the ­en form of a verb, use it in a
    sentence with "have," e.g., "I have ___________."   Here are some
    examples of the different forms:</p>

<table>
  <tr>   <th> Base</th><th>    -en Form</th><th>        -ed Form</th></tr>
  <tr>    <td>Think  </td><td>   Thought </td><td>     Thought</td></tr>
  <tr>    <td>Run    </td><td>   Run     </td><td>         Ran</td></tr>
  <tr>    <td>Go     </td><td>  Gone     </td><td>       Went</td></tr>
  <tr>    <td>Take   </td><td>  Taken    </td><td>     Took</td></tr>
  <tr>    <td>Move   </td><td> Moved     </td><td>   Moved</td></tr>
  <tr>    <td>Beat   </td><td> Beaten    </td><td>    Beat</td></tr>
  <tr>    <td>Yawn   </td><td> Yawned    </td><td>    Yawned</td></tr>
  <tr>    <td>Smile  </td><td> Smiled    </td><td>  Smiled</td></tr>
  <tr>    <td>Eat    </td><td>   Eaten   </td><td>     Ate</td></tr>
</table>

    <h3>(be + -ing) = A form of the verb "be" followed by the ­ing form of
    whatever verb comes next</h3> <p>These items are in parentheses because they
    aren¹t always present. When a "be" is present, the verb that immediately
    follows it MUST take the ­ing form.  The (be + -ing) conveys the
    progressive aspect, which includes information such as verb completion,
    duration, and repetition‹time-related elements that are not related to
    past, present, or future.</p>

    <h3>MV = Main verb. The main verb is not in parentheses because every verb
    phrase must contain a main verb</h3><p>The main verb is always the last item in
    the verb phrase. The main verb is the verb that decides that pattern of
    the sentence.</p>
